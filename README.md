# Phinstagram – Instagram Profile scrape (JSON)

A simple PHP snippet to scrape the https://www.instagram.com/<username> website. This script will provide you with a JSON formatted object that will enable you to grab the most recent images shown on the users profile page [instagram.com/sounden](https://www.instagram.com/sounden) and present the data the way you want.

# Why did I create Phinstagram?

I wanted to grab get the latest images from my [instagram.com](http://instagram.com) feed without connecting my account to third party apps. Since I could not find any public RSS or JSON feeds from Instagram I made this little simple PHP scrape/proxy script that will provide you with an JSON data feed scraped from the public Instagram profile website.
